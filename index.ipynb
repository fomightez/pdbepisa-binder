    "<font color='red'> **Hi, if you've come here from StackOverflow or Biostars, I've got a little more work to do to post all the content here, but wanted to share the script ASAP.** </font> Right now the only three notebooks posted are the first two and the one under the 'Technical' section below, called '[Single notebook converting a variety of formats of interface lists/reports to test handling by pisa_interface_list_to_df.py](notebooks/tests_of_pisa_interface_list_to_df.py.ipynb)'. THINK OF THOSE AS A 'QUICK-START' FOR NOW. The latter is definitely that and will remain because it is simply meant to put the script through its paces and see if updates break anything.  The [Working with PDBePISA interface lists/reports in Jupyter Basics and filtering to nucleic acid chains](notebooks/Working%20with%20PDBePISA%20interfacelists%20in%20Jupyter%20Basics.ipynb) just has the basics in place for now. I hope to expand it some.  \n",
    "Click either notebook below to open it and then select from the menubar above `Cell` > `Run All` to how to use it in Python or on the command line. (If you are using a true command line to run the script, replace '%run' in the example commands with `python` or `python3`, depending on your system.)  \n",
    "**ASAP I'll post a notebook demonstrating the use of it with snakemake that uses that script a list of PDB codes to allow you to get the interface report as a Python dataframe (Pandas dataframe specifically) FOR A LOT OF PDB FILES without little effort .** In the meantime please reach out to me. My email is on the left side [here](https://github.com/fomightez). \n",
